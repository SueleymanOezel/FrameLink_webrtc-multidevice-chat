# FrameLink WebRTC Multi-Device Chat

## Project Description

FrameLink is a WebRTC-based video chat application that enables seamless communication between multiple devices. It uses local face detection to automatically switch between devices (e.g., laptop, tablet, smart display) for camera and microphone usage. The switch between devices occurs automatically and without interruption.

**Goal:** Development of a WebRTC-based video chat application with multi-device support and dynamic switching of active devices based on local face detection.

## Features

- Peer-to-Peer Video Chat
